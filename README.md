# CakeOS
Custom operating system made in a modded Scratch website.

# ❔- What this operating system is -❔
This is an operating system I made in [PenguinMod](https://penguinmod.com) (modded Scratch website), that I have worked on over 1 month. I MIGHT make this a real OS in the future. (Only if I learn ****how to code**** of course.)

# ⚙️- How to use CakeOS -⚙️
1 - To open the Cake Menu (start menu as second name), click the CakeOS logo on the taskbar.

2 - To use the File Manager (beta), *****you currently can't.***** Because it barely has any functionality yet.

3 - You can adjust the taskbar scaling between *****Small***** and *****Normal (default)***** on the top right corner.
